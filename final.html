        <h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>In this project, we designed new textures to render in Minecraft using Blockbench. We created two different themes of textures and features: Japan theme and Candy theme. The Japan theme includes textures such as cherry blossom leaves, spiral leaves and koi fish, and features such as a pastel green day sky and swaying trees. The Candy theme includes candy-themed trees and patterned sand, as well as features such as twinkling stars and flashing comets in the night sky, a reflective pink seawater, and a pastel pink day sky with clouds. We also simulated two types of watercolor-effect filters on the rendered scene, implementing Gaussian blurring and bilateral blurring for a color-bleeding effect. </p>

		<h3>Textures</h3>

		<p>We designed and drew out textures for blocks and modified entities in Blockbench, for both the Candy and Japan-themed world. We set Blockbench’s Preview Scene feature to render and see assets in a simulated game environment before testing it in Minecraft. For our Candy-themed world, we made lollipop swirls, chocolate blocks and other bright, colourful, blocky textures with thick outlines. We also modified an existing entity of the tadpole in Minecraft to create a Lorax-like fish for our candy-themed world.
			For the Japan-themed world, we made much more subtle, abstract blocks of cobblestone, cherry blossoms, pink water and tree trunks.</p>

			<p>Here are some of the textures we designed (see slides and video for more examples):</p>

		<h2>Problems Encountered & Solutions</h2>

		<h3>Terrain Disappearing</h3>
		<p>Another error that we ran into was the terrain going missing while we were editing the vertex shaders. We tackled this by debugging exactly how we were editing the vertex positions, making sure that we were computing in the right spaces and scaling properly. For example, we realized that the line <code>gl_Position = ftransform();</code> was actually short for projecting a vertex from object/model space into camera space, then changed our approach accordingly to displace our vertices before this projection step.</p>

		<h3>Excess Blur Effect</h3>
		<p> While creating the watercolor effect, we initially only implemented Gaussian blurring and found the blur to be overpowering to the point where the whole screen was green and the whole screen was blue (depending on whether we were looking at a tree or the sky). To resolve this, we played around with different kernel sizes. We started out with a 10x10 kernel, which was really blurry, and then switched to a 3x3 kernel at some point, which ended up being too small to render a blur. We then reverted to the 5x5 kernel, which ended up being more distinct. This issue was also the motivation behind exploring different types of blurring effects, such as bilateral blurring, since we could preserve color between edges better. The hyperparameters we chose for bilateral blurring are shown in the code above. 
		</p>

		<h3>Knowing Which Files To Edit</h3>
		<p>When tinting the sky, we originally just tried to change the color to be pink (so the function would return). Then we realized the sky is according to biome. We realized this by referring to code from Minecraft Shader Wiki, which overwrote sky variable in composite.fsh.</p>

		<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
		<p>One of the first lessons that we learned was how to familiarize ourselves with the relevant software, shader documentation and GLSL language for our project. To set up rendering in Minecraft, we spent a decent amount of time researching which software tools to install (e.g. Minecraft, Optifine, Forge), and ultimately chose Minecraft with Optifine because of its built-in support for coding new GLSL shaders. It took us a couple of tries to install and set up compatible versions of Minecraft and Optifine, but this whole process taught us how to look up available resources and piece together the ones that best suited our goals. We also looked into the different Minecraft shader files and learned the order in which they render in a game – by taking the time to study the existing codebase and rendering engine, we got a good idea of exactly which shaders to edit for each of our ideas. While implementing our ideas, we learned to apply the concepts that we learned in class about texture mapping, lighting (Blinn Phong shading, one-bounce global illumination, reflection across materials) and shaders (cloth simulation vertex and fragment). We were excited to build upon these, such as trying to implement reflection off of a water surface while following Minecraft’s specific documentation, or simulating swaying trees by first editing the vertex shader for tree leaves to then displace and pass on per-vertex positions to the corresponding fragment shader.		</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<!-- <p>Final outputs include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Textured tree trunks and paths with cherry blossom and cobblestone patterns</li>
			<li>Watercolor shader applied to blocks and environment</li>
			<li>Packaged zip folder containing a bundled shader and resource pack</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Performance evaluation confirmed stable FPS (~60) with all shaders and animations active, and rendering quality was quantitatively evaluated using SSIM and MSE comparisons to reference textures. Artifacts were minimal following shader refinement.</p> -->
