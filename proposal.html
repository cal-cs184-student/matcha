        <h1>What in the World?</h1>
        
        <h4>Advika Bhike, Catherine Chu, Eshani Jha, Malavikha Sudarshan</h4>

        <p>We're building a Minecraft-style 3D environment in Unity that uses custom shaders to apply textures and non-photorealistic effects inspired by the four seasons of the year. Our goal is to explore how artistic styles can be integrated into real-time rendering using both procedural techniques and shader programming.</p> 
    
        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Games like Minecraft rely on a simple, iconic visual style: we want to take that foundation and turn it into something more artistically expressive. Our project looks at how to render stylised, themed environments in real time using shader-based techniques. The challenge is to create both visual richness and variety without sacrificing performance or relying on manually designed textures for every object.
            We’re tackling this by designing shaders that procedurally map 2D textures onto 3D voxel-style assets and by developing non-photorealistic effects that give the world a more handcrafted look. This is especially interesting in the context of real-time graphics because it blends technical rendering pipelines with creative direction, which is something that's not always easy to automate or generalise.</p>

        <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
        <h4>Part 1: Baseline Plan / What We Plan to Deliver</h4>
        <p>Our baseline plan is to deliver shader-based mods for Minecraft in Unity’s rendering pipeline, inspired by personalized themes, such as The Lorax and Japan. This will involve developing custom shaders to incorporate unique textures and artistic styles, then applying them to enhance the appearances of both existing Minecraft objects and our own theme-inspired assets (e.g. butterflies, swans, mountain tops).</p>
        
        <h5>Texture Shader</h5>
        <p>Our first objective is to develop a shader that performs texture mapping on assets within a 3D Minecraft-style mesh. For instance, in the Japan-themed demo, we will map 2D patterns of cherry blossoms and cobblestones onto the vanilla 3D models of trees and paths from the Minecraft framework. Specifically, the shader will utilize the approach outlined in the “Solid Texture Synthesis from 2D Exemplars” paper, which will allow us to efficiently generate novel 3D textures from the provided 2D examples.</p>
        
        <h5>Style Shader</h5>
        <p>To render non-photorealistic effects, our goal is to implement a watercolor-like appearance that complements the Japan theme. This shader will apply techniques including soft shading with a light falloff, blurring, global desaturation and noise to simulate the look of smooth, blended watercolor brush strokes on a grainy paper canvas.</p>
        

        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>
            The schedule for getting these specific tasks, as well as other miscellaneous tasks, is listed below. Each week we will each work on different tasks and plan to have it done by the Friday of that week.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have a synchronous meeting in-person (Zoom for emergencies) to touch base every Friday at 1pm (can be adjusted based on circumstance). During this time, we also plan to work on tasks that we decided we will all work together on. The immediate weekend of that week will be our buffer period.
          </p>
          <p>
            We definitely plan to have more meetings, but that will be planned on a more day-by-day basis. We plan to have our minimum deliverables done by Week 3, so we can have Week 4 as a buffer week for anything that takes an unexpected amount of time, or best case, work on some of the things we listed to do if we happened to have more time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the ambition tasks, we have allocated them to specific people, but ideally, we would work on them together since they seem more complicated. We formatted this to have a checkmark for everyone and have different tasks listed under each person. For tasks that will be shared and worked on together, we wrote that under “everyone”.

          <h4>Computing Platform, Hardware and Software</h4>
          <p>We'll primarily use our personal laptops for general coding, debugging, and development. For rendering shaders and animations, we will SSH into the EECS Instructional Machines, as they have GPUs better suited for graphics-intensive tasks.        </p>
          
          <p>We will use the following software resources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blender</strong>: Used to create static models such as stylized trees and rocks, as well as animated entities like butterflies. Models will be exported as .obj files.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockbench</strong>: Will import .obj files, convert them into .json for Minecraft compatibility, and allow UV mapping setup.</li>
            <li><strong>Unity with URP Shader Graph and HLSL</strong>: Used to design and prototype visual shaders. These prototypes will be validated in Unity before translation.</li>
            <li><strong>GLSL</strong>: Versions of shaders will be hand-coded based on Unity prototypes and implemented via Optifine’s .vsh and .fsh files.</li>
            <li><strong>Forge</strong>: Will handle Minecraft-side integration, including asset registration, block overrides, and environmental scripting.</li>
          </ul>
