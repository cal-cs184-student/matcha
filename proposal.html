        <p>We're building a Minecraft-style 3D environment in Unity that uses custom shaders to apply textures and non-photorealistic effects inspired by the four seasons of the year. Our goal is to explore how artistic styles can be integrated into real-time rendering using both procedural techniques and shader programming.</p> 
    
        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>Games like Minecraft rely on a simple, iconic visual style: we want to take that foundation and turn it into something more artistically expressive. Our project looks at how to render stylised, themed environments in real time using shader-based techniques. The challenge is to create both visual richness and variety without sacrificing performance or relying on manually designed textures for every object.
            We’re tackling this by designing shaders that procedurally map 2D textures onto 3D voxel-style assets and by developing non-photorealistic effects that give the world a more handcrafted look. This is especially interesting in the context of real-time graphics because it blends technical rendering pipelines with creative direction, which is something that's not always easy to automate or generalise.</p>

        <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
        <h4>Part 1: Baseline Plan / What We Plan to Deliver</h4>
        <p>Our baseline plan is to deliver shader-based mods for Minecraft in Unity’s rendering pipeline, inspired by personalized themes, such as The Lorax and Japan. This will involve developing custom shaders to incorporate unique textures and artistic styles, then applying them to enhance the appearances of both existing Minecraft objects and our own theme-inspired assets (e.g. butterflies, swans, mountain tops).</p>
        
        <h5>Texture Shader</h5>
        <p>Our first objective is to develop a shader that performs texture mapping on assets within a 3D Minecraft-style mesh. For instance, in the Japan-themed demo, we will map 2D patterns of cherry blossoms and cobblestones onto the vanilla 3D models of trees and paths from the Minecraft framework. Specifically, the shader will utilize the approach outlined in the “Solid Texture Synthesis from 2D Exemplars” paper, which will allow us to efficiently generate novel 3D textures from the provided 2D examples.</p>
        
        <h5>Style Shader</h5>
        <p>To render non-photorealistic effects, our goal is to implement a watercolor-like appearance that complements the Japan theme. This shader will apply techniques including soft shading with a light falloff, blurring, global desaturation and noise to simulate the look of smooth, blended watercolor brush strokes on a grainy paper canvas.</p>
        
        <h4>Part 2: Aspirational Plan / What We Hope to Deliver</h4>
        <p>If we end up working ahead of schedule, we also want to look at lightweight animation and motion effects to improve how realistic the game environment is.</p>
        
        <h5>Butterfly Animation</h5>
        <p>We plan to create a Unity script that animates the butterfly objects by making them orbit designated trees in a circular path, which can be defined by cosine and sine functions. Additionally, we may design a flapping motion by creating and interpolating between several key frames of wing positions.</p>
        
        <h5>Tree Swaying</h5>
        <p>By editing the vertex shader, we can incorporate a random noise function to subtly displace tree vertices. This will simulate natural motion, creating the idea of trees gently swaying in the wind.</p>
        
        <h5>Resulting Demo</h5>
        <p>In summary of our above overview, the result that we are going for is a Japan-themed Minecraft mod with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New Assets: butterflies, swans, mountain tops</li>
          <li>Texture Effects: cherry blossoms pattern applied on vanilla trees, cobblestone pattern applied on vanilla walking paths</li>
          <li>Style / Non-Photorealistic Effects: watercolor-style with soft lighting and shading, desaturation, grainy effect, stylized outlines</li>
          <li>(Aspirational) Motion Effects: butterflies moving about trees and flapping wings, trees swaying</li>
          <li>All effects tested and integrated into a bundled .zip shader and resource pack, ideally ready for installation via Optifine</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Why are these goals accomplish-able?</h5>
        <p>We think that we can accomplish these goals because previous assignments and course material have given us plenty of groundwork. In Homework 1, we implemented texture mapping in the 2D space, as well as anti-aliasing techniques like bilinear interpolation and level sampling with mipmaps. Here, we will build on this to then match 2D texture patches to 3D solids within the Minecraft mesh and compute anti-aliasing strategies in a higher dimension.</p>
        
        <p>In the Shader workshop, we learned that game engines like Unity are relatively user-friendly, with resources to easily upload templates, personalized meshes, assets, textures and scripts into the rendering pipeline. We think by choosing this pipeline, we can use these built-in tools and extend upon them, making this project both more feasible and creatively flexible.</p>
        
        <h5>Quality / Performance Evaluation</h5>
        <p>To measure the quality of this baseline shader system, we will create a metric to visually identify and evaluate the number of artifacts in the scene. This includes edges with jaggies and distorted textures (overly stretched, twisted, blurred) and can eventually be graphed to show successful anti-aliasing over our iterative improvements.</p>
        
        <p>We can also assess our synthesized renderings against the ground truth. By measuring metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), we can compute pixel-level differences in structure, color and texture. Our goal will similarly be to find regions where these errors exceed a certain threshold, then edit our scripts to reduce them accordingly.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we can benchmark performance in terms of gameplay smoothness and responsiveness. We can maintain a sufficient frame rate by comparing FPS using the Minecraft debug overlay before and after mod activation, targeting an FPS above 30. Additionally, we can measure shader switching times and visual transition delays, aiming to keep them under 100 ms.</p>
                

        <h3>Schedule</h3>
          <p>The schedule for getting these specific tasks, as well as other miscellaneous tasks, is listed below.<p>
          <p>Each week we will each work on different tasks and plan to have it done by the Friday of that week. We will have a synchronous meeting in-person (Zoom for emergencies) to touch base every Friday at 1pm (can be adjusted based on circumstance). During this time, we also plan to work on tasks that we decided we will all work together on. The immediate weekend of that week will be our buffer period. We definitely plan to have more meetings, but that will be planned on a more day-by-day basis.</p>
          <p>We plan to have our minimum deliverables done by Week 3, so we can have Week 4 as a buffer week for anything that takes an unexpected amount of time, or best case, work on some of the things we listed to do if we happened to have more time. For the ambition tasks, we have allocated them to specific people, but ideally, we would work on them together since they seem more complicated.</p>
          <p>We formatted this to have a checkmark for everyone and have different tasks listed under each person. For tasks that will be shared and worked on together, we wrote that under “everyone”.</p>
